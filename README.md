# Xeros - A Solana Development Assistant
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb770095-1f30-46e1-9961-49bc14cc37c3)

Xeros is a comprehensive development assistant for Solana blockchain development, built as a standalone implementation inspired by the [AGiXT](https://josh-xt.github.io/AGiXT/) framework. It combines powerful AI capabilities with specialized blockchain development tools to streamline the Solana development process.

## Relationship with AGiXT

Xeros is built as a standalone implementation that draws inspiration from AGiXT's architecture and principles:

- **Smart Instruct Implementation**: Like AGiXT, Xeros uses a sophisticated prompt management system for generating context-aware responses and code analysis.
- **Chain of Thought Processing**: Implements AGiXT's concept of workflow chains for complex development tasks.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Follows AGiXT's modular design principles while specializing in Solana blockchain development.

## Core Features

### 1. Code Assistance Module
- Rust/Anchor framework code generation and review
- Smart contract template recommendations
- Common problem solutions
- Test case generation
- Code optimization suggestions

### 2. Document Retrieval Module
- Real-time Solana technical documentation queries
- Anchor framework usage guides
- SPL token standard references
- Best practices guides
- Common error solutions

### 3. Development Toolchain Support
- CLI command assistance
- Development environment configuration
- Deployment process guidance
- Testnet usage guides
- Debugging tool recommendations
